- Use declarative animations with `animate` and `initial` props
- Implement gesture-based animations with `whileHover`, `whileTap`, etc.
- Optimize performance by using `layout` prop for smooth transitions
- Use variants for reusable animation states
- Implement scroll-based animations with `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks
