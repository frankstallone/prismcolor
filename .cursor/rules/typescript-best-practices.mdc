- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json for better type checking
- Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions and intersections
- Implement proper type inference and avoid explicit type annotations when possible
- Use type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Utilize mapped types and conditional types for advanced type manipulation
